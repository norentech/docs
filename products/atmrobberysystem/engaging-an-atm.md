# Engaging an ATM

By default, you need to **engage** the ATM before you can rob it. There are currently 2 engage methods available on the system, Disabled and Spare Buttons.

***

## Disabled

When you set the engage method to Disabled, the prompt to rob the ATM will always be visible on your labeled PromptPart. This is not recommended, but may be suitable for crime-focused games.

***

## Spare Buttons

When you set the engage method to Spare Buttons, the player must press any of the spare/blank keys on the ATM's keypad to make the prompt to rob the ATM visible on your labeled PromptPart. When an ATM is engaged through this method, the ATM will disengage automatically after the set time.

The ATM will not tell the player which key to press. You must inform the user yourself. For your reference, here are the spare/blank keys for each compatible ATM.
